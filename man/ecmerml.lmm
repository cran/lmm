.TL
ECME algorithm for restricted maximum-likelihood (RML)
estimation in linear mixed models
.DN
Computes RML estimates of parameters in linear mixed models
using the ECME procedure described by Schafer (1998). This
algorithm may be slow, requiring a large number of cycles
to converge. In most cases, "fastrml.lmm" will perform better.
This function is provided mainly for comparison against 
"fastrml.lmm". 

For a description of the model, see the "Details" section
below.
.CS
ecmerml.lmm(y, subj, occ, pred, xcol, zcol, vmax, start,
   maxits=1000, eps=0.0001)
.RA
.AG y
vector of responses. This is simply the individual yi vectors
stacked upon one another. Each element of y represents the 
observed response for a particular subject-occasion, or for a
particular unit within a cluster.
.AG subj
vector of same length as y, giving the subject (or cluster)
indicators i for the elements of y. For example, suppose 
that y is c(y1,y2,y3,y4) where length(y1)=2, length(y2)=3,
length(y3)=2, and length(y4)=7. Then subj should be
c(1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4).
.AG occ
vector of same length as y indicating the "occasions" for the
elements of y. In a longitudinal dataset where each individual
is measured on at most nmax distinct occasions, each element
of y corresponds to one subject-occasion, and the elements of
of occ should be coded as 1,2,...,nmax to indicate these
occasion labels. (You should label the occasions as
1,2,...,nmax even if they are not equally spaced in time; the
actual times of measurement will be incorporated into the
matrix "pred" below.) In a clustered dataset, the elements 
of occ label the units within each cluster i, using the labels
1,2,...,ni.
.AG pred
matrix of covariates used to predict y. The number of rows
should be length(y). The first column will typically be
constant (one), and the remaining columns correspond to other
variables appearing in Xi and Zi.
.AG xcol
vector of integers indicating which columns of pred will be
used in Xi. That is, pred[,xcol] is the Xi matrices (stacked
upon one another.
.AG zcol
vector of integers indicating which columns of pred will be
used in Zi. That is, pred[,zcol] is the Zi matrices (stacked
upon one another).
.OA
.AG vmax
optional matrix of dimension c(max(occ),max(occ)) from which
the Vi matrices will be extracted. In a longitudinal dataset, 
vmax would represent the Vi matrix for an individual with
responses at all possible occasions 1,2,...,nmax=max(occ);
for individuals with responses at only a subset of these
occasions, the Vi will be obtained by extracting the rows
and columns of vmax for those occasions. If no vmax is
specified by the user, an identity matrix is used. In most
applications of this model one will want to have Vi =
identity, so most of the time this argument can be omitted.
.AG start
optional starting values of the parameters. If this argument
is not given then the function chooses its own starting values.
This argument should be a list of three elements named
"beta", "psi", and "sigma2". Note that "beta" should be a
vector of the same length as "xcol", "psi" should be a
matrix of dimension c(length(zcol),length(zcol)), and
"sigma2" should be a scalar.
.AG maxits
maximum number of cycles to be performed.
The algorithm runs to convergence or until "maxits"
iterations, whichever comes first.
.AG eps
convergence criterion. The algorithm is considered to have
converged if the relative differences in all parameters from
one iteration to the next are less than eps--that is, if
all(abs(new-old)<eps*abs(old)).
.RT
a list containing the following components.
.RC beta	
vector of same length as "xcol" containing estimated fixed
effects.
.RC sigma2
estimate of residual error variance.
.RC psi
matrix of dimension c(length(zcol),length(zcol)) containing
estimated variances and covariances of the random effects.
.RC converged
T if the algorithm converged, F if it did not.
.RC iter
number of iterations actually performed. Will be equal
to "maxits" if converged=F.
.RC loglik
vector of length "iter" reporting the value of the
"restricted" loglikelihood at each iteration.
.RC cov.beta
matrix of dimension c(length(xcol),length(xcol)) containing
estimated variances and covariances for elements of "beta".
These are conventional estimates which regard the variance
parameters (sigma2 and psi) as fixed at their RML estimates.
.RC b.hat
a matrix with length(zcol) rows and m columns, where
b.hat[,i] is an empirical Bayes estimate of bi.
.RC cov.b
an array of dimension length(zcol) by length(zcol) by m,
where cov.b[,,i] is an empirical Bayes estimate of the
covariance matrix associated with bi. These are
conventional estimates which regard the variance
parameters (sigma2 and psi) as fixed at their RML estimates.
(An improved version which incorporates variance-parameter
uncertainty is available from the function "fastrml.lmm".)
.DT
For details of the algorithm, see Section 3 of Schafer (1998).

The model, which is typically applied to longitudinal or
clustered responses, is 

	yi = Xi%*%beta + Zi%*%bi + ei ,    i=1,...,m,

where

	yi    = (ni x 1) response vector for subject
		or cluster i;
	Xi    = (ni x p) matrix of covariates;
	Zi    =	(ni x q) matrix of covariates;
	beta  = (p x 1) vector of coefficients common to the
		population (fixed effects);
	bi    = (q x 1) vector of coefficients specific to
		subject or cluster i (random effects); and
	ei    = (ni x 1) vector of residual errors.

The vector bi is assumed to be normally distributed
with mean zero and unstructured covariance matrix psi, 

	bi ~  N(0,psi) independently for i=1,...,m.

The residual vector ei is assumed to be

	ei ~ N(0,sigma2*Vi)

where Vi is a known (ni x ni) matrix. In most applications,
Vi is the identity matrix.
